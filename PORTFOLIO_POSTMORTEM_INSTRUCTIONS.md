### 1. Project Overview (Context, Not Hype)

- What the project is
- Why it exists
- Who it is for

Keep this short and grounded.

---

### 2. The Real Problem

Describe the **actual problem**, not the surface task.

Good examples:

- Presenting emotionally heavy long-form writing on the web
- Avoiding distraction in narrative experiences
- Translating prose into spatial rhythm

Avoid:

- “Build a website”
- “Render Markdown”

---

### 3. Constraints (This Is Where Senior Thinking Shows)

List constraints explicitly:

- technical
- experiential
- accessibility
- scope
- emotional tone

Constraints are a feature, not a limitation.

---

### 4. Design Philosophy

Explain:

- how typography supports meaning
- how spacing creates pacing
- how motion is restrained
- why silence matters

This is where taste is demonstrated.

---

### 5. Architectural Decisions

Explain:

- server vs client separation
- why certain components are client-only
- how Markdown is parsed vs rendered
- how images are handled responsibly

Focus on **why**, not implementation detail.

---

### 6. What Was Deliberately Not Done

This section is critical.

Explain what you chose to exclude:

- excessive animation
- heavy libraries
- feature creep
- unnecessary interactivity

This signals maturity.

---

### 7. Technical Challenges & Resolutions

Briefly discuss:

- any architectural pitfalls encountered
- how they were identified
- how they were resolved cleanly

Avoid dramatizing bugs.
Focus on reasoning.

---

### 8. Outcome

Describe the result in human terms:

- how it feels to use
- what it communicates
- what it proves about your approach

---

### 9. What This Project Demonstrates

Explicitly connect the project to:

- your strengths
- your values
- the kind of work you want to do

This helps clients self-select.

---

### 10. What You’d Do Next (Optional)

Only include if:

- it adds insight
- it doesn’t undermine the finished work

Avoid roadmaps for roadmaps’ sake.

---

## Tone Guidelines

- Calm
- Precise
- Reflective
- Confident without bravado

Assume an intelligent reader.

---

## Final Rule

> A good postmortem makes the reader think
> “This person knows when to stop.”

---

## How to Use These Together

- **AI_ENGINEERING_RULES.md** → governs how work is produced
- **PORTFOLIO_POSTMORTEM_INSTRUCTIONS.md** → governs how work is explained
