## 📋 Core Engineering Principles

[Merge best content from both documents - philosophical + technical]

1. Think in Systems, Not Files
2. Default to Simplest Viable Architecture
3. Server/Client Boundaries Are Hard Lines
4. Every Client Component Requires Justification
5. Avoid Legacy or Hidden Behavior
6. Animation Is Communication, Not Decoration
7. Typography Is a Core System
8. Build for Failure States
9. Compilation Is Non-Negotiable
10. Write Code for the Next Reader
11. Clarify Before Guessing
12. Respect the User's Attention

[Each with concise rules + examples]
