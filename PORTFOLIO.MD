## The Marble Does Not Yield

_A production-grade example of narrative intelligence, system design, and restraint._

**The Marble Does Not Yield** is a long-form, single-page narrative experience built with **Next.js 14**, designed to demonstrate how complex human experiences can be translated into clear, accessible, and performant digital systems.

At a surface level, it is a literary work.  
At a systems level, it is a case study in **how to design for humans under cognitive load**.

This project showcases how I approach:

- translating ambiguity into structure
- using AI tools as collaborators rather than generators
- balancing expressiveness with performance and accessibility
- making deliberate decisions about what _not_ to build

### Why this project matters

Most digital experiences optimize for speed, conversion, or novelty.  
This one optimizes for **attention, comprehension, and emotional pacing**—the same constraints that apply to:

- AI-assisted products
- complex decision systems
- high-stakes user flows
- tools used by tired, stressed, or overloaded humans

The site is intentionally quiet. Motion is restrained. Typography is disciplined. Every design choice exists to support clarity rather than distract from it.

This mirrors how I design AI-driven systems:  
**not to impress users, but to respect them.**

### What this demonstrates

- **AI-augmented development**  
  Used AI assistants as collaborators for analysis, refactoring, documentation, and design reasoning—without surrendering authorship or judgment.

- **Editorial systems thinking**  
  Content is markdown-driven, structurally separated from presentation, and designed for long-form readability.

- **Human-centered motion design**  
  Animation is purposeful, optional, and accessibility-first, respecting reduced-motion preferences by default.

- **Performance and discipline**  
  Static generation, optimized assets, minimal dependencies, and production-ready deployment configuration.

- **Clear separation of concerns**  
  Narrative, presentation, motion, and configuration live in distinct layers—making the system maintainable and extensible.

### Why this is relevant to AI consulting

AI systems increasingly operate in contexts where:

- users are overwhelmed
- decisions have consequences
- clarity matters more than cleverness

This project reflects how I approach those problems:

- start with the human experience
- design systems that reduce cognitive friction
- use AI as leverage, not as a crutch
- ship work that is calm, explainable, and trustworthy

**This project is not a demo of features.  
It is a demonstration of judgment.**
